==== WPCargo Shipment Container Addon ====

 ===========================================================
            Plugin Description
 ===========================================================

WPCargo Shipment Container add on allows you to group multiple shipments travelling in the same vicinity into one full truckload. If you only use half or a quarter of a space in one truckload, you will typically still have to pay for the entire space. Shipment Container will help your clients save money by sharing the space with other shippers thus only paying for the space that their freight takes up. It is also recommended for companies with multiple branches to help them group shipments by location.
